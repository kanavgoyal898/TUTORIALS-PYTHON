# Python Tutorials

Welcome to the **Python Tutorials** repository! This collection of tutorials is specifically designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers learn Python programming effectively. Whether you're just getting started with coding or looking to enhance your existing skills, you'll find a wealth of useful resources here. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge and tools needed to tackle real-world programming challenges using Python.

## Introduction

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used across various domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Known for its simplicity and readability, Python allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than many other languages. This repository aims to provide comprehensive tutorials that cover a wide range of Python topics, from fundamental concepts to more advanced techniques. Each tutorial is structured to build upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth learning curve and a deeper understanding of the language.

## Tutorials

### Basic Python Tutorials

Here is a brief overview of the tutorials available in this repository:

1. **Install and Setup for Mac and Windows** - [here](./tut01.py)
   - This tutorial guides you through the process of installing Python on both Mac and Windows systems. It covers setting up your development environment, including the installation of IDEs or text editors that will facilitate your coding journey.

2. **Strings - Working with Textual Data** - [here](./tut02.py)
   - Dive into the world of strings, which are sequences of characters. This tutorial covers string manipulation, formatting, and methods for processing textual data effectively in Python.

3. **Integers and Floats - Working with Numeric Data** - [here](./tut03.py)
   - Explore how Python handles numeric data types, including integers and floats. This tutorial provides insights into arithmetic operations, type conversion, and the importance of numeric data in programming.

4. **Lists, Tuples and Sets** - [here](./tut04.py)
   - Learn about Python’s built-in data structures: lists, tuples, and sets. This tutorial highlights their unique properties, use cases, and the operations you can perform on each.

5. **Dictionaries - Working with Key-Value Pairs** - [here](./tut05.py)
   - Understand how to use dictionaries, a powerful data structure in Python that stores data in key-value pairs. This tutorial demonstrates how to create, access, and manipulate dictionaries effectively.

6. **Conditionals and Booleans - if, elif and else Statements** - [here](./tut06.py)
   - This tutorial introduces control flow in Python through conditional statements. Learn how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions in your programs based on different conditions.

7. **Loops and Iterations - for/while Loops** - [here](./tut07.py)
   - Explore the concept of loops in Python, focusing on `for` and `while` loops. This tutorial teaches you how to repeat actions efficiently and iterate over sequences and collections.

8. **Functions** - [here](./tut08.py)
   - Functions are a fundamental building block in Python programming. This tutorial covers how to define and call functions, pass arguments, and return values, emphasizing the importance of code reusability.

### Object-Oriented Programming Tutorials

1. **Classes and Instances** - [here](./oop01.py)
   - Discover the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. This tutorial explains how to create classes and instances, enabling you to model real-world entities in your code.

2. **Class Variables** - [here](./oop02.py)
   - Learn about class variables, which are shared across all instances of a class. This tutorial illustrates their use and how they differ from instance variables.

3. **classmethods and staticmethods** - [here](./oop03.py)
   - This tutorial delves into `classmethods` and `staticmethods`, explaining their roles and use cases in class design. Understand how to leverage these methods for better organization in your code.

4. **Inheritance - Creating Subclasses** - [here](./oop04.py)
   - Explore the concept of inheritance, a key feature of OOP. This tutorial teaches you how to create subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, promoting code reuse and extensibility.

5. **Special (Magic/Dunder) Functions** - [here](./oop05.py)
   - Special functions, often referred to as magic or dunder functions, allow you to define how your objects behave with built-in Python operations. This tutorial introduces commonly used magic functions and their applications.

6. **Property Decorators - Getters, Setters and Deleters** - [here](./oop06.py)
   - Learn how to use property decorators to create getter, setter, and deleter methods for class attributes. This tutorial emphasizes encapsulation and data protection in your class designs.
